This project is wholely based on the github.com/relab/hotstuff project, the main difference is that we add the pbeegees consensus package, which is a noval BFT algorithm I proposed that is an improvement to the BeeGees BFT algorithm[1]. However, the original framework that the relab project provides is not perfectly suitable for pBeeGees (and BeeGees), so there are lot of trivial modification in everywhere of the original project. The detailed specification of this project and the pBeeGees algorithm is still in progress.
